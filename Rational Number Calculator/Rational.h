class Rational {
  /*OVERVIEW
    Represent a rational number as a ratio of two integers, numerator and
    denominator.
    Think of the rational number as equivalent to numerator/denominator.
    You want to avoid
    running into unnecessary overflow problems since C++ limits
    the range of integers. Observe the following rules to keep
    your rational numbers in "reduced form" to
    avoid unnecessary integer overflows and wrong results:

    Invariant #1: Keep denominator as always >= 0. numerator can be negative,
    0, or positive.

    Invariant #2: numerator and denominator should not have a common factor
    other than 1.
    Eliminate any common factors.

    Invariant#3: When the rational number is equivalent to an integer,
    including 0, denominator must be 1.

    Invariant#4: When denominator is 0, numerator must be -1, 0, or 1.

    Note: You can assume that for all caculations that we will give
    you, both numerator and denominator for all rational numbers will
    be small enough to not cause integer overflows. But, your code
    should be able to handle situations like 2/3 being repeatedly multiplied
    by 100/100 without overflowing. You will be fine as long as you always
    keep your rational numbers in reduced form.

// For example, if numerator is 3 and denominator is 1, then print out 3.
// If numerator is 3 and denominator
// is 2, print out 3/2. If numerator is -4 and denominator is 3, print out -4/3.
